            <p>
                Absolutely nothing. I have been 'developing' my web development skills, so I just wanted to practise. I don't like
                filling the site with 'lorem ipsum' so I will write randomly about: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anime</li>
                <li>Investing and Stock Market</li>
                <li>Computer Science and Programming</li>
                <li>Other Cool Stuff</li>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">CS Quote Of The Day</h2>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;text-align: justify;">
                “History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money, time, and effort someone will expend to thwart a 
                security system. It’s always better to assume the worst. Assume your adversaries are better than they are. Assume science 
                and technology will soon be able to do things they cannot yet. Give yourself a margin for error. Give yourself more 
                security than you need today. When the unexpected happens, you’ll be glad you did.”
            </p>
            <p> - Bruce Schneier, Security Researcher</p>

            <p style="font-style:oblique;text-align: justify;">
                "You need a different checklist and different mental models for different companies. I can never make it easy body
                saying, 'Here are three things.'You have to derive it yourself to ingrain it in your head for the rest of your life."
