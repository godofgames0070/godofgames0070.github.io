Aim: Nothing. I just wanna practise my web development skills.

* Anime
* Other Cool Stuff

## Quote Of The Day:
*"Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are."* — Danny Thorpe
