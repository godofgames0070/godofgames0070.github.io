                        On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along would be the last thing in people's 
                        minds. After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant 
                        to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. 
                        Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On 
                        the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that 
                        make him look like a gentle delinquent. Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two 
                        quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, 
                        they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.

                        10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the 
                        ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as "Hunters". 
                        However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk 
                        his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the "World's Weakest". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely 
                        earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the 
                        hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a 
                        strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained 
                        in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the 
                        strongest S-rank Hunter!
