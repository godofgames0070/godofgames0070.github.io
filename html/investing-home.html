                                In The Little Book that Beats the Market—a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print—Greenblatt
                                explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula
                                that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices.

                                The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns is a
                                2007 and 2017 book on index investing, by John C. Bogle, the founder and former CEO of the Vanguard Group. He
                                focuses on index funds, which will give the investor the average market return, and on keeping investing costs low,
                                so that the index fund investor will consistently do better than other investors, after costs. Trying to beat the
                                market "is a loser's game," according to Bogle and "the more the managers and brokers take, the less investors make."
