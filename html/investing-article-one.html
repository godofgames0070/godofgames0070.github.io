                            Look at earnings yield and return on capital to evaluate stocks.
                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            Joel’s magic formula is based entirely on two typical numbers used to judge the quality of a stock, combined with
                            a few rules and guidelines. The first is earnings yield. This number tells you how many dollars you can expect to
                            make, per year, for each dollar you invest in a stock.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            You need last year’s earnings per share (how much money the company earned, divided by the total number of shares
                            available), and the current stock price to figure it out. Dividing the two leaves you with a number in the format
                            earnings per dollar, or, simply, your expected return in percent. For example, if last year, the company earned
                            $0.85 per share, and now the stock price is $17, you divide 0.85 by 17, which leaves you with an earnings yield
                            of 0.05. That’s an expected return of 5% for your money, or 5 cents for every dollar you invest.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            The second number is return on capital (=ROC). This is calculated by dividing the net, after-tax profit the company
                            made last year, by the book value (the number on their official balance sheet) of invested capital. This tells you
                            how much of your investment the company turns into an actual profit. For example, if a $500,000 investment into a
                            new steel production plant has yielded a $200,000 profit in its first year, that gives you an ROC of 40%, which is
                            really good. Joel says anything above 25% is solid.

                            Pick winning companies by combining these two factors and ranking them.

                        <p class="heading-text">
                            Okay, now what do you do with those numbers? You calculate them. For every single company available on a major US
                            stock exchange, like the 3,500 you can find on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            Then, you make two lists. On the first one, you rank all of the companies, starting with the one with the highest
                            earnings yield. The second list you order by highest ROC. Now, you combine both rankings into one.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            For example, if the company, which ranks first for earnings yield, ranks 153 for ROC, you add both numbers together,
                            giving it a total ranking of 154.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            In the end, this leaves you with a single, ordered list, telling you which companies perform best for both factors
                            combined. Joel suggests you then invest into the 20-30 top companies on that list, and hold each stock for a year.
                            After a year, sell winners and losers and repeat the process.
                        </p>

                            Note: Of course you don’t have to do all of this by hand. Joel’s come up with a

                            Be patient, it’s what makes this formula unpopular, but effective.
                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            If you invested $10,000 in the US, based on Joel’s magic formula, in 1988, you would’ve turned those $10k into
                            $1,000,000 by 2009 (yes, including the financial crisis). Fantastic results, right?
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            So why the hell doesn’t everyone do it already?
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            Because consistency is boring. If you follow this formula, you can’t tell your friends about “that new investing
                            strategy you found” every 3 months. You can’t brag at all for a year, because only then do you find that year’s
                            winners and losers. What’s more, this strategy actually might perform worse than the market at times (it usually
                            does for one of every four years). Sometimes even two years in a row.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            But if you rigorously stick to it, you are guaranteed to win. The sticking is the hard part.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            That’s why money managers and financial advisors can’t use it. Their clients expect profits. Not just in the
                            long-run, but every year. That’s nonsense, of course, but it forces analysts to resort to short-term strategies,
                            just so they can keep their clients satisfied all year round.
                        </p>
                        <p class="heading-text">
                            You know better now. Don’t be greedy. Don’t be in it for the short term. Have some discipline. You could be a
                            millionaire in 20 years.
